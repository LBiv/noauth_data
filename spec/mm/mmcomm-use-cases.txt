Use Case Attributes

Communication Model
-------------------

mm communicates on top of HTTPS. There are two types of connections:

- mm client to mm server
- mm server to mm server

The communication model for both types of connection is identical. Therefore,
hereinafter in this document we refer to HTTPS client as Client regardless of
whether it is mm client or mm server except where elaboration is required. We
always refer to mm server that is HTTP server as Server.

The communication model is identical to that described in yjps-use-cases.txt
with the following additions:

- the protocol always works on top of HTTPS (port 443);
- there is implicit state shared between Client and Server;
- the shared state is associated with session ID that is an array of ASCII
  characters;
- session ID is carried by some proocol messages as JSON string with the key
  "sessId".
